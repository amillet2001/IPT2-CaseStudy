        <p>

            ‚ÄúNews itself makes our society updated not only in our region, but all over the globe.‚Äù News are what we hear every day in the form of gossips. And basically, news is indeed a vital part in how we live, whether you like it or not. Especially with the rise of social media networks in the mid-2000‚Äôs. And because most of us are too lazy and bored to read from news sites like the NY Times or the Huffington Post, they brought the news to us through their Facebook Pages, YouTube Videos, and Twitter Accounts. Forget the newspapers, you could just scroll through your news feed and BOOM! You‚Äôre now updated.  But us teenagers, even though most of us would just abandon news channels and try to change the channel as much as possible to watch our favorite shows. One good example of that is ABS-CBN, a Filipino news media giant. Nowadays, they have various YouTube channels depending on which or what kind of content you prefer to watch. There‚Äôs the Entertainment section, the News section, replays from their shows. 

        </p>

        <p>

            Nonetheless, there is one major factor that the media corporation have. When it comes to power, they have the upper hand on how they control the flow of news. And there are times when they make one little mistake which actually resulted for the network to sign-off for the last time on May 5, 2020. Thousands of employees were laid off. In the middle of a pandemic, broadcast industry regulators succumbed to pressure from an ‚Äúalter ego‚Äù of President Rodrigo Duterte and ordered ABS-CBN, the country‚Äôs largest media network, to go off the air. Now that ABS-CBN is out of the airwaves, and for the second time since martial law, there is no more denying that the Duterte administration will stop at nothing‚Äîeven amid a national emergency and a crippling lockdown‚Äîto crush dissent and stifle a free and independent media. But the previous House hearings have exhaustively discussed the network‚Äôs franchise issues, including the citizenship of ABS-CBN chair emeritus Gabby Lopez; the possible violation of the constitutional limits on foreign ownership; reported labor, and tax violations; and other violations of the terms of its legislative franchise. Therefore, even though ABS-CBN may or may not admit to these allegations, it is still clear and there is no denying that the network may have done these anomalies for the past 25 years. 

        </p>

        <p>

            I, for one, believe that the closure of the network is fair and square as we have in the television on how these proceedings were conducted. The hearings were attended by members of Congress, ABS-CBN‚Äôs executives and lawyers, as well as resource persons from various government agencies who were concerned on how the network operated under the 25-year contract. Turns out the network was pretty much at fault. But the one thing that‚Äôs pretty unorthodox here is how the President remarked on how he wanted the owners to ditch and sell the network and its resources, even though he said in later comments that he had nothing to do with the network‚Äôs shutdown. Nevertheless, this administration that we have today proves that no one is above the law even the biggest conglomerate in the country wasn‚Äôt even safe from the accusations of malicious practices they had done inside.

        </p>

        <p>

            As the award-winning writer Albert Camus once said, ‚ÄúA free press can, of course, be good or bad, but, most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad.‚Äù

            This single post took me minutes, hours, days, weeks even got to the point that it took a month for me to make this message. I was supposed to take a picture with her holding a card that I made, but unfortunately, I just didn‚Äôt have the time and also her schedule was pretty full. But still, I decided to make her this message hoping that she has an account. Anyways, still wanting to tell a short story about her. She is the most understanding teacher I‚Äôve had the past years in that school. Well, I guess it‚Äôs still October and I guess i‚Äôts still national teachers‚Äô day so this entry would be still considered as a greeting haha. <strong> So Ma‚Äôam Nes, Happy Teacher‚Äôs Day po. More good things to come. </strong>

        </h4>

        <p>

            Social interaction is vital to us teenagers (but not only to teenagers, but also to all ages) living in the current decade as our old (not really old but only dating back to early 1990‚Äôs) methods of long-distance communication like the traditional SMS (Short Message Service) is in the brink of the status of becoming obsolete as the rise of online messaging services applications like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, iMessage, and many more in mid-2010‚Äôs made an innovation of communication worldwide, or even, changed our ways forever.

        </p>

        <p>

            But first, we‚Äôll have to travel down back through memory lane to see how SMS became the necessity over the last decade. Let‚Äôs begin in 1992 where in Neil Papworth sent the first message (the message was ‚ÄúMerry Christmas.‚Äù) to Richard Jarvis‚Äô phone who was at a party in Newbury, Berkshire which had been organized to celebrate the event. Eventually in 1997, the QWERTY keyboard era began. The Nokia 9000i Communicator becomes the first phone to come equipped with a keyboard. Then in 2000, text messaging takes off wherein with the new feature where texting with other people on other networks, Americans begin sending (a now comically low) 35 texts per month. But in 2002, text messaging became a blast. More than 250 billion SMS messages are sent worldwide. Four years later. Twitter makes its debut as a text-message-based service. But text messaging became the most widely used mobile data service in the late 2000‚Äôs. But evidences were foreseen as the use of text messages declined because simply the service itself is still payable unlike the free-to-use online messaging. It‚Äôs safe to say that SMS will still be usable in the coming of years. But not in a few decades. I know this is not directly connected or related to social media category, but SMS was (or still currently a foundation for many upcoming social media sites to come) also a fundamental aspect towards the history of long-distance communication.

        </p>

        <p>

            But what are the effects of using social networking sites (or even, the Internet) in our generation?

        </p>

        <p>

            <strong>
                             
                Anything is accessible nowadays. 

            </strong>
                
            If you want to search something, go to Google. Want to buy or sell something, we have eBay & Amazon. Want to find or listen to a specific song, Spotify & YouTube are in. Get the point? Everything in the palm of your hands. Sounds like an advertising slogan but still, true.

            <strong>

                The Internet made books obsolete. 

            </strong>

            We don‚Äôt need those bulky and expensive books to handle or bring home to study this, study that. Basically, you just type in a keyword that comes within your mind. Then poof, the magic comes on.

            <strong>
                             
                Connecting people. 
                
            </strong>

            Title is pretty self-explanatory, trying to connect with other you haven‚Äôt talked with for a long time before is pretty hard because this will cost money. But now, with the help of Facebook, finding people is made to be easy.

            <strong>
                             
                Not everything can be trusted on the internet. 
                
            </strong>

            If what they say is likely to be correct, it is likely to be correct. If what they say is likely to be wrong, it is likely to be wrong. It‚Äôs funny how something that sounds as obvious as this isn‚Äôt exactly obvious to many people.

            <strong>
                             
                Increased harm as a victim in cyberbullying. 
                
            </strong>            

            These sites have caused some potential harm to society. The students become victims of social networks more often than anyone else. This is because of the reason that when they are studying or searching their course material online, they get attracted to these sites to kill the boredom in their study time, diverting their attention from their work.
